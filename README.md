# SPinPong - VR TableTennis Training System

This is the official repository of the paper "SPinPong - Virtual Reality Table Tennis Skill Acquisition using Visual, Haptic and Temporal Cues" which deals with a VR table tennis training system targetting novice players. The system is designed to make users understand and acquire the specific skill of returning strong spin serves. This approach makes use of slow-motion (which we call Temporal Distortion) as well as various visual cues as shown below.
